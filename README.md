# Awesome Starlark
*A list of awesome things related to the Starlark language.*

Starlark is a simple, Python-like language designed to be embedded in another application to provide configuration or scripting abilities.

## Getting Started

*   [The language specification](https://github.com/bazelbuild/starlark/blob/master/spec.md)

*   There are 3 known implementations of the Starlark language:
    -   [starlark-go](https://github.com/google/starlark-go/) - an implementation in Go.
    -   [starlark-rust](https://github.com/facebookexperimental/starlark-rust) - an implementation in Rust.
    -   [starlark/java](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/tree/master/src/main/java/net/starlark/java) - an implementation in Java
      built for Bazel, that may not be suitable for use in other applications.

*   Bindings:

    -  [HarikrishnanBalagopal/starlark-webasm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/starlark-webasm) - a webassembly package for starlark-go.
    -  [python-starlark-go](https://github.com/caketop/python-starlark-go) - Python bindings for Starlark in Go.
    -  [starlark-pyo3](https://github.com/inducer/starlark-pyo3) - Python bindings for Starlark in Rust.

## Tools

* [Buildifier](https://github.com/bazelbuild/buildtools) - The official code formatter &
  linter. It can also apply automated fixes (e.g. remove unused loads).

   between Starlark in Go's `StringDict` type and Go structs.
*  [Startype](https://github.com/vladimirvivien/startype) - a library that
   implements two-way conversion between Starlark in Go API types and regular
   Go types.

## IDEs

Some IDEs have a [plugin for Bazel](https://bazel.build/install/ide).
Otherwise, consider using a Python mode.

*  [Starpls](https://github.com/withered-magic/starpls) - a language server
   for Starlark.

## Community
